ElTeeDee
========

This is the on device display process for a raspberry PI running eltee. It displays
some basic information that about the device itself as well as communicates and
possibly even sorta controls eltee.

The idea is that the linux world boots into command line mode and then this writes
to the display buffer - or something like that.
